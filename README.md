# Optimatics Product Guide

This is an interactive hierarchical sunburst diagram communicating the data provided of Optimatics platform capabilities. With distinct colours and labels per component, you can interactively zoom down to the layer you are interested in. At any time, you can only see at most 2 rungs of the diagram to keep the graphic accessible and simple, allowing a user to choose their area of focus or interest without being overwhelmed.

**Motivation:** To support sales team and users by providing a guide to Optimatic's product line. It will help Optimatics present and explain their products. The guide will also help users choose a product given their application, and vice versa. It will be used to assist prospects and existing clients in exploring use cases for Optimizer.
